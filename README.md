Sure! Here's a refined description of the project:

The PDF-Chat project aims to develop a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model and a vector database. The goal is to create a chatbot that can interact with users and provide responses based on natural language understanding and generation.

The chatbot's functionality will be specifically tailored to handle conversations related to PDF documents. Users will be able to ask questions, seek information, or request assistance regarding PDF-related topics. The chatbot will utilize the capabilities of GPT to comprehend user inputs and generate informative and contextually appropriate responses.
